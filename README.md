hello world (my initial repository)
I went to my Doctor you know my Doctor...Dr. Vinny Boombahtz...my doctor
I said "Doc, what's wrong with me?"
He said "What's wrong with you?...I'll tell you whats wrong with you...you're FAT"
I said - "Oh yeah? - I want a second opinion!
He said - "Alright...you're ugly too"
Ok? alright I tell you...I don't get no respect, no respect at all.

This hotel tht I'm staying in right now, I don't wanna say they're a bad hotel but - THEY stole MY towel!!
